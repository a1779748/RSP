## Instruction
1. `ADM-AdjacencyList.cpp`: type `make ADM` to see the running result.
2. `easyGraph.cpp`: type `make easy` to see the running result.
3. type `make clean` to remove all cpp executable file

## AdjacencyList
> Only implement the undirected graph(directed graph is like half undirected graph

1. `ADM-AdjacencyList.cpp`
    * This one is like cpp version of ADM's adjacency-list Graph(The same functionality and the same logical)
    * `graph_ADM.in` is the input Graph of this program.
        this graph looks like:
        1----2 
        |  / | \
        | /  |   3
        |/   | /
        5----4

2. `easyGraph.cpp`
    * Only use `vector` to represent the Graph, which is easier than the ADM version I think.
    * Include Adjacency List and Matrix, both only use vector.

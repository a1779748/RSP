## TEST INSTRUCTION

1. move code into `main.cpp`
2. goto terminal, type `./test.sh`


## LinkedList

1. `LinkedList_ADM_version.cpp` is the ADM's version:
	- which I implement the search recursivly
	- do not follow ADM's "delete", instead I use itertive approach

2. `LinkedList_iterate_oop_version.cpp` is the LinkedList implemented using `class`
	- all methods are using iterative approch
	- also have some custermized constructor, which makes initialize list easier.

3. Both 1 and 2 are simple and basic sigly Linked List
	- Only have three basic operation
	- each node only have `data` and one `pointer`
